/**
 * Greeter Test Class. STUDENTS - it is safe to assume these tests
 * are correct when you are debugging your Greeter.java
 *
 * <p>In Test Driven Development, tests are written before the code is written.
 * This is to ensure that you have carefully defined the
 * requirements of each method. It also helps to ensure that the code is
 * correct, and that it is maintainable. It is also a good way to ensure
 * that the code is testable, and that it is modular.</p>
 *
 * <p>However, to many programmers, it often feels like a chicken and egg,
 * and can feel tedious. It is also often difficult to write tests for
 * code that requires interaction with the client, file system, or network.
 * We will explore a few ways do that this semester, but for now, we will
 * only focus on testing methods that are easier to test. </p>
