/**
 * AlohaAarld is a simple greeter program that takes in input from the client, and greets them with
 * different greetings.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is the "Driver" of the program. Most drivers only contain the main method, and are
 * used to start the program.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Btw, this is a multi-line comment. It is also in a special format called Javadoc. Javadoc is a
 * special type of comment that can be used to generate documentation. It is often used to document
 * classes and methods. HTML can(and should) be included in these comment types.
