capacity.

* one per row, add more if needed
TA: Ethan Olesinski - gave me pointers on common issues other students faced or asked and helped confirm the tasks I needed to carry out.
TA: Estelita Chen - let me know I had the wrong version of Java and helped debug errors she mentioned she hasn't seen before i.e. issues with unicode. Despite not being able to help me run the code without errors, working with her helped me in the right direction to power through in troubleshooting. Eventually, for the first time in this course, I successfully was able to run the code after several sleepless nights.

No, at least not yet.
